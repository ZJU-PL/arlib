# C++ Monadic Abstraction Helpers

This directory contains a C++ implementation of the monadic abstraction
algorithms from `aria.monabs.cores`, written against the Z3 C++ API.

## Provided targets
- `monabs_app` – static library with the core algorithms (`monabs.hpp` / `monabs.cpp`)
- `monabs_example` – small driver that mirrors the Python tests and prints results

## Building (CMake)
1. Install Z3 with C++ libraries (`z3++`). On macOS you can use `brew install z3`.
2. From this directory:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   cmake --build build
   ./build/monabs_example
   ```
   If CMake cannot find Z3 automatically, set `-DZ3_DIR=/path/to/z3/cmake`.

The example prints result vectors using the same encoding as the Python code:
`sat(1)`, `unsat(0)`, and `unknown(2)`.
